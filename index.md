# Wiggly notebooks, zero friction


"A collection of creative AnyWidgets for Python notebook environments."


## These docs are special


The documentation for wigglystuff is designed for humans (via hosted marimo notebooks) and robots (via markdown pages to quickly paste into prompts). The reasoning behind this is explained in more detail in this YT video. Follow the links in each example below to find the resources that you're looking for.


## Install wigglystuff

Each widget page embeds a marimo-powered html-wasm export and links back to the exact notebook that generated the demo, so you can open the original `.py` file and rerun it locally.


## 3rd party widgets


These widgets depend on 3rd party packages. They still ship with wigglystuff but have demos hosted on molab because many of the dependencies are not compatible with WASM.
